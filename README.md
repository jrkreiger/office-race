# Office Race
_A webscraping and data visualization project_

The goal of this project is to produce an animated "racing" barplot to visualize cumulative lines spoken by various characters on the TV series _The Office_. I'm starting by scraping the scripts of every _Office_ episode from a website.

This is a work in progress, so check back occasionally for updates.
